//! This crate defines [`Float`]s, which are arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers.
//!
//! [`Float`]s are currently experimental. They are missing many important functions. However, the
//! functions that are currently implemented are thoroughly tested and documented, with the
//! exception of string conversion functions. The current string conversions are incomplete and
//! will be changed in the future to match MPFR's behavior.
//!
//! # Demos and benchmarks
//! This crate comes with a `bin` target that can be used for running demos and benchmarks.
//! - Almost all of the public functions in this crate have an associated demo. Running a demo
//!   shows you a function's behavior on a large number of inputs. TODO
//! - You can use a similar command to run benchmarks. TODO
//!
//! The list of available demos and benchmarks is not documented anywhere; you must find them by
//! browsing through
//! [`bin_util/demo_and_bench`](https://github.com/mhogrefe/malachite/tree/master/malachite-float/src/bin_util/demo_and_bench).
//!
//! # Features
//! - `32_bit_limbs`: Sets the type of [`Limb`](malachite_nz#limbs) to [`u32`] instead of the
//!   default, [`u64`].
//! - `test_build`: A large proportion of the code in this crate is only used for testing. For a
//!   typical user, building this code would result in an unnecessarily long compilation time and
//!   an unnecessarily large binary. My solution is to only build this code when the `test_build`
//!   feature is enabled. If you want to run unit tests, you must enable `test_build`. However,
//!   doctests don't require it, since they only test the public interface.
//! - `bin_build`: This feature is used to build the code for demos and benchmarks, which also
//!   takes a long time to build. Enabling this feature also enables `test_build`.

/// A floating-point number.
///
/// `Float`s are currently experimental. They are missing many important functions. However, the
/// functions that are currently implemented are thoroughly tested and documented, with the
/// exception of string conversion functions. The current string conversions are incomplete and will
/// be changed in the future to match MPFR's behavior.
///
/// `Float`s are similar to the primitive floats defined by the IEEE 754 standard. They include NaN,
/// positive and $-\infty$, and positive and negative zero. There is only one NaN; there is no
/// concept of a NaN payload.
///
/// All the finite `Float`s are dyadic rationals (rational numbers whose denominator is a power of
/// 2). A finite `Float` consists of several fields:
/// - a sign, which denotes whether the `Float` is positive or negative;
/// - a significand, which is a [`Natural`] number whose value is equal to the `Float`'s absolute
///   value multiplied by a power of 2;
/// - an exponent, which is one more than the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the `Float`'s
///   absolute value;
/// - and finally, a precision, which is greater than zero and indicates the number of significant
///   bits. It is common to think of a `Float` as an approximation to some real number, and the
///   precision indicates how good the approximation is intended to be.
///
/// `Float`s inherit some odd behavior from the IEEE 754 standard regarding comparison. A `NaN` is
/// not equal to any `Float`, including itself. Positive and negative zero compare as equal, despite
/// being two distinct values. Additionally, (and this is not IEEE 754's fault), `Float`s with
/// different precisions compare as equal if they represent the same numeric value.
///
/// In many cases, the above behavior is unsatisfactory, so the [`ComparableFloat`] and
/// [`ComparableFloat`] wrappers are provided. See their documentation for a description of their
/// comparison behavior.
///
/// In documentation, we will use the '$=$' sign to mean that two `Float`s are identical, writing
/// things like $-\text{NaN}=\text{NaN}$ and $-(0.0) = -0.0$.
///
/// The `Float` type is designed to be very similar to the `mpfr_t` type in
/// [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Nomenclature-and-Types), and all Malachite
/// functions produce exactly the same result as their counterparts in MPFR, unless otherwise noted.
///
/// Here are the structural difference between `Float` and `mpfr_t`:
/// - `Float` can only represent a single `NaN` value, with no sign or payload.
/// - Only finite, nonzero `Float`s have a significand, precision, and exponent. For other `Float`s,
///   these concepts are undefined. In particular, unlike `mpfr_t` zeros, `Float` zeros do not have
///   a precision.
/// - The types of `mpfr_t` components are configuration- and platform-dependent. The types of
///   `Float` components are platform-independent, although the `Limb` type is
///   configuration-dependent: it is `u64` by default, but may be changed to `u32` using the
///   `--32_bit_limbs` compiler flag. The type of the exponent is always `i32` and the type of the
///   precision is always `u64`. The `Limb` type only has a visible effect on the functions that
///   extract the raw significand. All other functions have the same interface when compiled with
///   either `Limb` type.
///
/// `Float`s whose precision is 64 bits or less can be represented without any memory allocation.
/// (Unless Malachite is compiled with `32_bit_limbs`, in which case the limit is 32).

/// relation: that is, that two equal objects should not be different in any way.
///
/// To be more specific: when a [`Float`] is wrapped in a `ComparableFloat`,
/// - `NaN` is not equal to any other [`Float`], but equal to itself;
/// - Positive and negative zero are not equal to each other;
/// - Ordering is total. Negative zero is ordered to be smaller than positive zero, and `NaN` is

///
