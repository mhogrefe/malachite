/// An enum that specifies how a value should be rounded.
///
/// A `RoundingMode` can often be specified when a function conceptually returns a value of one
/// type, but must be rounded to another type. The most common case is a conceptually real-valued
/// function whose result must be rounded to an integer, like
/// [`div_round`](crate::num::arithmetic::traits::DivRound::div_round).
///
/// # Examples
/// Here are some examples of how floating-point values would be rounded to integer values using the
/// different `RoundingMode`s.
///
/// | x    | `Floor` | `Ceiling` | `Down` | `Up` | `Nearest` | `Exact`    |
/// |------|---------|-----------|--------|------|-----------|------------|
/// |  3.0 |       3 |         3 |      3 |    3 |         3 |          3 |
/// |  3.2 |       3 |         4 |      3 |    4 |         3 | `panic!()` |
/// |  3.8 |       3 |         4 |      3 |    4 |         4 | `panic!()` |
/// |  3.5 |       3 |         4 |      3 |    4 |         4 | `panic!()` |
/// |  4.5 |       4 |         5 |      4 |    5 |         4 | `panic!()` |
/// | -3.2 |      -4 |        -3 |     -3 |   -4 |        -3 | `panic!()` |
/// | -3.8 |      -4 |        -3 |     -3 |   -4 |        -4 | `panic!()` |
/// | -3.5 |      -4 |        -3 |     -3 |   -4 |        -4 | `panic!()` |
