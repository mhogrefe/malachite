//! This crate defines [`Rational`]s. The name of this crate refers to the mathematical symbol for
//! rational numbers, $$\mathbb{Q}$$.
//! - There are many functions defined on [`Rational`]s.
//!   These include
//!   - All the ones you'd expect, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division;
//!   - Functions related to conversion between [`Rational`]s and other kinds of numbers, including
//!     primitive floats;
//!   - Functions for Diophantine approximation;
//!   - Functions for expressing [`Rational`]s in scientific notation.
//! - The numerators and denominators of [`Rational`]s are stored as [`Natural`]s, so [`Rational`]s
//!   with small numerators and denominators can be stored entirely on the stack.
//! - Most arithmetic involving [`Rational`]s requires (automatically) reducing the numerator and
//!   denominator. This is done very efficiently by using the high performance GCD and exact
//!   division algorithms implemented by [`Natural`]s.
//!
//! # Demos and benchmarks
//! This crate comes with a `bin` target that can be used for running demos and benchmarks.
//! - Almost all of the public functions in this crate have an associated demo. Running a demo
//!   shows you a function's behavior on a large number of inputs. For example, to demo
//!   [`Rational`] addition, you can use the following command:
//!   ```text
//!   cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 10000 -m exhaustive -d demo_rational_add
//!   ```
//!   This command uses the `exhaustive` mode, which generates every possible input, generally
//!   starting with the simplest input and progressing to more complex ones. Another mode is
//!   `random`. The `-l` flag specifies how many inputs should be generated.
//! - You can use a similar command to run benchmarks. The following command benchmarks various
//!   addition algorithms:
//!   ```text
//!   cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 1000000 -m random -b \
//!       benchmark_rational_add_algorithms -o add-bench.gp
//!   ```
//!   or addition implementations of other libraries:
//!   ```text
//!   cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 1000000 -m random -b \
//!       benchmark_rational_add_assign_library_comparison -o add-bench.gp
//!   ```
//!   This creates a file called gcd-bench.gp. You can use gnuplot to create an SVG from it like
//!   so:
//!   ```text
//!   gnuplot -e "set terminal svg; l \"gcd-bench.gp\"" > gcd-bench.svg
//!   ```
//!
//! The list of available demos and benchmarks is not documented anywhere; you must find them by
//! browsing through
//! [`bin_util/demo_and_bench`](https://github.com/mhogrefe/malachite/tree/master/malachite-q/src/bin_util/demo_and_bench).
//!
//! # Features
//! - `32_bit_limbs`: Sets the type of [`Limb`](malachite_nz#limbs) to [`u32`] instead of the
//!   default, [`u64`].
//! - `test_build`: A large proportion of the code in this crate is only used for testing. For a
//!   typical user, building this code would result in an unnecessarily long compilation time and
//!   an unnecessarily large binary. My solution is to only build this code when the `test_build`
//!   feature is enabled. If you want to run unit tests, you must enable `test_build`. However,
//!   doctests don't require it, since they only test the public interface.
//! - `bin_build`: This feature is used to build the code for demos and benchmarks, which also
//!   takes a long time to build. Enabling this feature also enables `test_build`.
